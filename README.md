# embrace
Embrace is a microsite created by a made-up swimwear brand, Skin and Salt. 

Users are encouraged to go to the website and submit personal stories about their journey of self-discovery and self-acceptance.

This website was created as part of the Intro to web development course run by Code First Girls.
