                    <p>We are Chloe, Tarni and Siobhan, founders of Salt and Skin - beautifully flattering and tonal swimwear and all-natural bodycare products. Our friendship and business was born in Bondi, Australia as after spending ages trying to find swimwear that fit us, we have decided to take matters into our own hands and design something ourselves.</p>
                    <p>The first designs were a bit wonky but after trial and error we were pleased to launch our first collection.</p>
                    <p>As we want each of you to feel special, we have decided to launch <em>Embrace</em>, a space for you to inspire and empower one another.</p>
                    <p>If like us, you were on a journey to uncover your inner confidence and beauty, please <a href="./submit.html" style="color: #E79578;"> share with us your story</a>. </p>
                    <p>If you would like to visit our shop, please go to the main website.</p>
